### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Gradients are hard to eyeball; getting them to look exactly like the design docs was a struggle, especially the result circle.
- I've gotten better with flexbox and planning ahead for which elements need to be parent flexbox containers.

### Continued development

- In this project, I was given the colors in the style guide, but I wasn't sure of how to properly utilize them. Paying more attention to the colors and opacities to get the right color is something I want to work on.
